A collection of computational physics projects

Project 2: The restricted three-body problem.

Project 3: The force damped non-linear pendulum.

Project 4: The diffusion equation in 1D and 2D solved using numerical integration.

Project 5: Comparing the thermodynamical quantities of a square-lattice 2D Ising model obtained by a Monte-Carlo technique and an analytical solution.
