# Compuational-Physics
A collection of computational physics projects

Project 2: Simulating the restricted three-body problem and testing a variety of initial conditions.

Project 3: Simulating the force damped non-linear pendulum.

Project 4: The diffusion equation in 1D and 2D solved using numerical integration.

Project 5: A square 2D Ising model is simulated via a 2D matrix of 0s and 1s. A Monte-Carlo technique is then applied to obtain values for certain thermodynamic quantities such as the mean magnetization and the heat capacity of the system. These values are then compared to an analytical solution.
